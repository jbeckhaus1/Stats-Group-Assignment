Part One - Load and clean up data
--------------------------------------------------------

Load and clean the data is the csv file

Some of the records (rows) in the data set are inconsistent, in that either the total species count does not equal
the sum of the counts for the three species, or the variable FlyingFoxesAbsent does not match the total count being
zero or not.
Remove inconsistent records from the data set.

```{r}
#load the data from csv
foxData = read.csv("FlyingFoxMonitoring.csv",header = TRUE)

#converting factor to integer
blkFox <- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$BlackFlyingFox.Count))))
redFox<- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$LittleRedFlyingFox.Count))))
greyFox<- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$GreyHeadedFlyingFox.Count))))
totalFox <- suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$TotalSpecies.Count))))


#remove rows where variable FlyingFoxesAbsent does not match the total count being zero or not.

idHasFox=which(foxData$FlyingFoxesAbsent!=TRUE)
idHasNoFox=which(suppressWarnings(c(as.numeric(as.character(foxData$TotalSpecies.Count))))!=0)
illogicalFox=setdiff(idHasFox,idHasNoFox)

blkFox=blkFox[-illogicalFox]
redFox=redFox[-illogicalFox]
greyFox=greyFox[-illogicalFox]
totalFox=totalFox[-illogicalFox]
##removing data with NA

#make a vector of the rows which have missing data
idNA=c(which(is.na(blkFox)),which(is.na(redFox)),which(is.na(greyFox)),which(is.na(totalFox)))
paste(length(idNA),"cases have NAs")

#remove those rows
blkFox=blkFox[-idNA]
redFox=redFox[-idNA]
greyFox=greyFox[-idNA]
totalFox=totalFox[-idNA]


#calculate totals based on each species
myTotal = blkFox+redFox+greyFox
diffTotals = totalFox-myTotal

#make a vector where if the difference between the actual total and the sum of each species doesn't match the value is NA and if it does it's "good"
idBadMath=ifelse(diffTotals!=0,NA,"good")
paste(sum(is.na(idBadMath)),"rows have totals that dont match the sum of each species")
#making a vecor of the NAs (which are actually the rows with bad maths)
idBadMath=which(is.na(idBadMath))



#removing the rows that have bad maths
blkFox=blkFox[-idBadMath]
redFox=redFox[-idBadMath]
greyFox=greyFox[-idBadMath]
totalFox=totalFox[-idBadMath]




```

Interpret the solution of the problem.

Part Two - Camp size
--------------------------------------------------------
(a) [2 marks] Analyse the distribution of the total camp size (TotalSpecies.Count) and the distribution of the
natural logarithm2 of the total camp size for non-empty camps.
Explain why the logarithm of the camp size is the more meaningful variable to consider.
```{r}
##natural logarithm of the total species count per camp
log.CampSize=log(totalFox)
#paste(totalFox,logCampSize)
#logCampSize
totalFox.length=length(totalFox)

##histogram of camp size logarithm
hist(log.CampSize)
```


(b) [2 marks] Use bootstrapping to compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean logarithm of the total camp size for
non-empty camps.
Interpret your result.
```{r}

##boot strap of mean camp size logarithm
##Generating a Bootstrap Distribution
b = 10000
boot.dist = rep(NA, b)
for (i in 1:b) {
boot.sample = sample(b, replace=TRUE)
boot.dist=log(boot.sample)

}
mean(boot.dist >= log.CampSize)

```

Part Three - Species Proportions
--------------------------------------------------------

(a) [2 marks] Compute the proportions of each species at each camp site and visualise them. Then compute the overall
proportions of each species.
Discuss your results.

```{r}

```

(b) [2 marks] Analyse whether the total camp size and the proportion of Little Red Flying Foxes are associated by
testing at a signifcance level of 1% whether whether there is evidence that the correlation between the total size of
a camp and the proportion of Little Red Flying Foxes in that camp is non-zero.
Interpret your results.

```{r}

```
